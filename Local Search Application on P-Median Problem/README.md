#Local Search Application on P-Median Problem
LSPMedian.py contains the python code.
Both best improvement and last improvement is implemented and can be switched by the "greedy" parameter in LocalSearch function
Size of the move operator (2-swap, 3-swap etc. can be changed fron neighborRadius paramter.
Algorithm can be applied to any dataset in the specified form. If quick try is desired, than demo function can be used.
